This is audio visualizer unity project. I got inspired by Ukiyo-e from Japan and some images I founded online : https://www.pinterest.com.au/pin/2885187253194280/ and https://www.pinterest.com.au/pin/1055249756413601550/

It may have different performances in different sound settings in different computers. 

The sound capture in the built project seems not working, and I don't know how to fix it :(

Project Description:
all the dynamic objects including waves, sun, particle systems and bird flocks are controlled by the Sound Capture
The waves' amplitutde and Ocataves are controlled by peak volume and average volume from the soundcapture
The particles was controll by the wave's height 
The shape(noises) of the Sun is control by the flicker, and pulse from the soundcapture
The bird flock is motivated by the following a cube that rotating in the sky, the cube's rotation speed is controled by the average volume, and flocks' speed are controlled by peak volume.
The Sakura particles are controlled by the peak volume it will do a 500 emission when the peak volume over 0.8.
